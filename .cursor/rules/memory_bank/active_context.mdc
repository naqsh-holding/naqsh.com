## Current Work Focus
**Status**: Project Documentation and Memory Bank Establishment
**Date**: December 2024
**Phase**: Post-Development Documentation and Project Intelligence Setup

## Recent Significant Changes
- **Project Description Update**: Updated `.cursor/rules/project_description.mdc` to accurately reflect the current implementation
- **Memory Bank Creation**: Establishing comprehensive project documentation structure
- **Technical Review Completed**: Comprehensive analysis of codebase, dependencies, and features

## Current Tasks
1. **Memory Bank Setup** - Creating all required Memory Bank files
2. **Project Intelligence Documentation** - Capturing implementation patterns and technical decisions
3. **Progress Tracking** - Documenting completed features and current status

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete Memory Bank file creation (system_patterns.mdc, tech_context.mdc, progress.mdc)
2. Review and validate all documentation against actual codebase
3. Identify any gaps in project documentation
4. Establish ongoing documentation maintenance procedures

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Theme System**: Scroll-triggered dark/light theme using GSAP
- **Animation Strategy**: GSAP ScrollTrigger for section animations
- **Content Management**: Static data with TypeScript interfaces
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with unoptimized setting
- **Form Integration**: Pipedrive for contact form handling

### Current Technical State:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.16 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Animations**: GSAP with ScrollTrigger plugin
- **Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom implementations
- **Content**: 5 news articles, 5 featured projects, 42 brand logos

### Pending Questions for User:
- Are there any specific performance targets or benchmarks to document?
- Should we establish specific SEO keyword strategies?
- Are there any planned future features or integrations to document?
- What is the preferred deployment strategy and hosting environment?

## Critical Context for Immediate Tasks

### Codebase Structure:
```
app/
├── components/
│   ├── sections/     # Main page sections
│   ├── layout/       # Navigation and layout components
│   └── ui/           # Reusable UI components
├── lib/
│   ├── data/         # Static content data
│   ├── hooks/        # Custom React hooks
│   └── utils/        # Utility functions
├── news/             # Dynamic news pages
├── projects/         # Dynamic project pages
└── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Key Implementation Patterns:
- **Section-based Architecture**: Each major section is a separate component
- **Theme-aware Components**: Components adapt to light/dark theme
- **GSAP Integration**: Scroll-triggered animations throughout
- **TypeScript Interfaces**: Strong typing for all data structures
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints

### Current Known Issues:
- None identified during recent review
- All major features appear to be functioning as intended
- Documentation gaps being addressed through Memory Bank creation

## Temporary State and Focus
- **Primary Focus**: Establishing comprehensive project documentation
- **Secondary Focus**: Validating technical implementation against requirements
- **Documentation Priority**: Ensuring all Memory Bank files are complete and accurate

## Recent Findings and Insights
- **Theme System Complexity**: The scroll-triggered theme system is more sophisticated than initially documented
- **Content Structure**: Well-organized static data with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Animation Strategy**: Comprehensive GSAP implementation with ScrollTrigger
- **Brand Showcase**: Sophisticated infinite scroll animation for 42 brand logos
- **Performance Considerations**: Proper image optimization and loading strategies

## Critical Considerations for Next Actions
1. **Documentation Accuracy**: Ensure all Memory Bank files reflect actual implementation
2. **Technical Debt**: Identify any areas needing refactoring or optimization
3. **Future Scalability**: Document patterns for easy feature additions
4. **Maintenance Procedures**: Establish clear documentation update processes
